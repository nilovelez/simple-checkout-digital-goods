Removes billing address fields from the checkout page when you only have downloadable and virtual products in the cart.

== Description ==

There are some cases where you don't need all the billing fields of a digital product checkout. This plugin lets you remove some fields of the checkout page when all the products in the cart are downloadable or virtual.

Please keep in mind that you will need those fields for invoicing if you are charging for the products.


Check the fields you want to remove from the checkout page.
